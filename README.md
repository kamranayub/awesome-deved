# Awesome DevEd

A collection of awesome DevEd.

> DevEd is "developer education" and as part of DevRel can encompass documentation sites, community hubs, blogs, tutorials, articles, courses, talks, games, showcases, webinars, workshops, platforms, universities/academies, visual essays, interactive playgrounds, and more. Whatever helps educate developers on a technology or product.

Curated by [Kamran Ayub](https://kamranayub.com?ref=awesome-deved) to spotlight and showcase the awesome DevEd everyone is creating.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. "Awesome" is subjective but in general, awesome DevEd is typically "effortful" (not "just" a tutorial/article/how-to), unique in nature, has had evidence-backed impact, or pushes the boundaries of what it means to be "content" such as incorporating gamification, interactivity, or creative production techniques. This is what I refer to as "[umami-flavored](https://kamranayub.com/umami?ref=awesome-deved)" content that leaves a really good taste in your mouth. Notably it does _not_ need to depend on the creator being "known". Anyone can create Awesome DevEd.
