# Awesome DevEd Pantry

A collection of awesome DevEd.

> DevEd is "developer education" and as part of DevRel can encompass documentation sites, community hubs, blogs, tutorials, articles, courses, talks, games, showcases, webinars, workshops, platforms, universities/academies, visual essays, interactive playgrounds, and more. Whatever helps educate developers on a technology or product.

Curated through the [DevEd Test Kitchen](https://devedtestkitchen.com) by "Chef" Kamran to spotlight and showcase the awesome DevEd everyone is cooking up around us.

# Contributing

Donations to the pantry are welcome. "Awesome" is subjective but in general, awesome DevEd is typically "effortful" (not "just" a tutorial/article/how-to), unique in nature, has had evidence-backed impact, or pushes the boundaries of what it means to be "content" such as incorporating gamification, interactivity, or creative production techniques. This is what I refer to as "[umami-flavored](https://kamranayub.com/umami?ref=awesome-deved)" content that leaves a really good taste in your mouth. Notably it does _not_ need to depend on the creator being "known" or considered a "celebrity chef". Anyone can cook Awesome DevEd.
